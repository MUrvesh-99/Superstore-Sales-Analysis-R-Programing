# Superstore-Sales-Analysis-R-Programing

This project analyzes a fictional **Superstore dataset** to uncover insights into sales performance, customer satisfaction, return behavior, and inventory efficiency.

### Key Steps:

**Data Cleaning**: Standardized text fields, handled missing values using median imputation, and ensured numeric formatting.

**Feature Engineering**: Created new metrics —

Satisfaction_Return_Ratio (Customer Experience vs Returns)

Performance_Index (Sales, Satisfaction, Returns combined)

Inventory_Stress (Stock vs Sales)

### Visual Insights:
Most customers are satisfied, but return rates remain moderately high.

Clothing has the highest average sales but also higher returns.

High inventory stress correlates with low sales.

“Retail X” is a top-performing brand; “Outlet Y” underperforms.

### Strategic Business Recommendations:

Improve product quality and descriptions to reduce returns.

Focus on high-performing brands.

Reduce overstocking of slow-moving items.

Target neutral customers to boost retention.

Built in R with ggplot2, dplyr, and Quarto.
